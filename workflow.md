# Development Workflow: Lumina Advisory Website

This document outlines the workflow and decision-making process used to build the Lumina Advisory Investment Website.

## 1. Project Planning
- **Goal**: Create a premium, high-trust website for an investment advisory firm.
- **Tech Stack**: Semantic HTML5, Vanilla CSS (Modern), Vanilla JavaScript.
- **Design Direction**: "Premium" aesthetic using Deep Navy and Gold colors, with Serif typography for headings.

## 2. Project Setup
- **Directory Structure**:
    - `index.html`: Main entry point.
    - `css/style.css`: Styles and variables.
    - `js/script.js`: Interactive logic.
- **Design System Implementation**:
    - Established CSS Variables for colors (`--color-primary`, `--color-secondary`) and fonts.
    - Used 'Playfair Display' for elegance and 'Inter' for readability.

## 3. Implementation Steps
1.  **Skeleton**: Built the semantic HTML structure (Header, Main, Footer).
2.  **Hero Section**: Implemented a dark, high-impact hero area with a gradient background.
3.  **Services**: Created a responsive grid layout for service cards with hover effects.
4.  **About Section**: Added a two-column layout for company philosophy.
5.  **Contact Form**: Built a detailed inquiry form with comprehensive styling.
6.  **Responsive Design**: Used CSS Media Queries to ensure mobile compatibility (stacking grids, adjusting font sizes).

## 4. Verification & Clean-up
- Checked mobile responsiveness.
- Verified form layout.
- Ensured consistent spacing and typography.

## Future Recommendations
- **Backend**: Connect the contact form to a mail server or API.
- **Content**: Replace placeholder images and text with real client data.
- **SEO**: Enhance meta tags with specific keywords based on client location.
